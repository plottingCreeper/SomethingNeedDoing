--conditions 26 + 34 is when we will try to buy chocobo skills  "combat and bound by duty"
--also no cutscenes (cond 35) should be running

--we will use a 15 second loop as we aren't in any rush to spam buy these skills. we can even make it a 30 or 60 second check....
--also we should probably limit the buying attempts for level 30 to 50
